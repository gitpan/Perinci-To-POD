NAME
    Perinci::To::POD - Generate POD documentation for a package from Rinci
    metadata

VERSION
    version 0.36

SYNOPSIS
    You can use the included peri-pkg-doc script, or:

     use Perinci::To::POD;
     my $doc = Perinci::To::POD->new(
         name=>"Foo::Bar", meta => {...}, child_metas => {...});
     say $doc->gen_doc;

    To generate documentation for a single function, see
    Perinci::Sub::To::POD or the provided command-line script peri-func-doc.

    To generate a usage-like help message for a single function, you can try
    the peri-func-usage from the Perinci::CmdLine distribution.
